libqform
========

Ideal Class Group Arithmetic in Imaginary Quadratic Number Fields.

This requires liboptarith and it should be checked out in a sibling folder
otherwise you'll need to adjust the SConstruct include path.

You will also need scons to build these packages and a fairly recent version of gcc.

There are some tests in the tests/ folder.

Documentation will gradually be updated and hopefully a C++ class wrapper.
