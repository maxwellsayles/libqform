libqform
========

Imaginary Quadratic Number Field Arithmetic.

This requires liboptarith and it should be checked out in a sibling folder
otherwise you'll need to adjust the SConstruct include path.

You will also need scons to build these packages.

There are some tests in the tests/ folder.

Documentation will be gradually updated.
